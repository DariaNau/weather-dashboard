# Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Description

The OpenWeather API is used to retrieve weather data for cities. AJAX is used to hook into the API to retrieve data in JSON format. The App runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## Installation

Please visit the deployed project at: https://darianau.github.io/weather-dashboard/. 

## Usage
Introduction to server-side APIs. See the detailed instructions below.

### Instructions

The following under current weather conditions are displayed:
1. City
2. Date
3. Icon image (visual representation of weather conditions)
4. Temperature
5. Humidity
6. Wind speed
7. UV index
A search history is included so that users can access their past search terms. Clicking on the city name performs a new search that returns current and future conditions for that city.

A 5-Day Forecast below the current weather conditions is also included. Each day for the 5-Day Forecast displays the following:
1. Date

Multiple functions created within the application to handle the different parts of the dashboard:
